Parking Lot Management System (Low-Level Design)

Overview: 
This repository contains the low-level design (LLD) implementation of a Parking Lot Management System in Python. The system simulates the core functionality of a parking lot, including vehicle entry, exit, parking slot allocation, and fee calculation.

Features:
  Manage multiple types of vehicles (e.g., cars, bikes, trucks).
  Allocate and deallocate parking slots dynamically.
  Support for different parking fees based on vehicle type and parking duration.
  Easily extendable for additional features like reservations or payment integrations.

Design Principles:
  Object-Oriented Design: Classes are structured for modularity and reusability.
  Scalability: The design supports adding new parking levels and slot types.
  Extensibility: Future enhancements like multi-parking lot support can be added without major changes.
